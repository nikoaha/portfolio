						Team CTR has experienced tears, sweat and sacrificed many hours for

						"One day, we just went to eat to the cafeteria and Niko said this stupid joke about 
						combining the famous Finnish bodybuilder's name 'Bull Mentula' and the Japanese 
						animation's name Full Metal Alchemist and turned it to 'Bull Mental Alchemist'. 
						That is where it all started."
						<br>
						<br>
						"Why does the main character have to get to the gym?"
						<br>

						"Well... *awkward laughing* The main character in the game is Bull Mentula himself, so

						Roope: "Proper scaling in the game objects was messed up many times and
